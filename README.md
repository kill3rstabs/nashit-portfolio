## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16 or later) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## üö¢ Deployment

This project is set up for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Install `gh-pages`:**
    ```sh
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2.  **Add deploy scripts to `package.json`:**
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
      // ... other scripts
    }
    ```
    
3. **Add `homepage` to `package.json`:**
   ```json
    "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
   ```

4.  **Deploy the application:**
    ```sh
    npm run deploy
    ```

This will create a `gh-pages` branch on your repository, and your site will be available at the URL specified in the `homepage` field.
